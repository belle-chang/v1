                My primary interest is exploring how computer science can be intertwined with other fields, such as medicine or sports, to evolve or create innovative technologies. I would love to work in software development/engineering or project management. Other passions of mine include experimenting with new recipes, 
                perusing Spotify for the latest new hits, and hitting up my local hiking trails.

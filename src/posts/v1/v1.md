__**Technical Skills/Technologies Used:**__ Gatsby, React, HTML & CSS

Since I finished my Puerto Rico teaching trip mid-summer, I decided it'd be fun to make a website porfolio of my most salient projects and work. I had also never really done any front-end development (other than dabbling in it a bit for [SurfRider](http://anabelle-chang.netlify.com/projects/surfrider)), so I thought it'd be a great opportunity to learn some more HTML and CSS, as well as React, since my adviser had told me what a coveted skill it was. 

I first started off with a little bit of research and came across Gatsby after looking at other developers' portfolios for inspiration, and decided to go with it, since I knew I wanted to make a static site. After watching a few tutorials, I finally started and drastically underestimated how difficult it was to craft a beautiful web page with HTML and CSS from scratch... 

Since embarking on this project, I think I've gained a better feel for front-end web development, a skill I want to continually develop in the next few years. While I know this website is pretty basic and nowhere near the avant-garde ones I've seen, I hope to someday get there! 

Cheers!

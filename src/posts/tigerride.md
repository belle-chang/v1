In Spring 2019, I took a class COS333: Advanced Programming Techniques, during which I created a web application with a few others that would allow for students to organize sharing Uber, Lyft, or other transportation services to and from the Princeton University campus. I was mostly in charge of the back-end development, but I also dabbled a bit in databases.
